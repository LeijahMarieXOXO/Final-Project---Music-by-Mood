# Feeling Good

Published on: 2025-07-11

Welcome to my _Feeling Good_ blog post. I will be making blog posts to showcase Music by Mood.

## So far I have posted positive mood music, with 3 songs highlighted and inlcuded album art, YouTube links and a snapshot of the lyrics.

1. **Meant to Be**: A song by Bebe Rexha.

2. **Music is Your Love**: A song by a chinese artist, Lay.

3. **Classic**: A song by MKTO. 

## What's next

I will post on two other emotions and begin with CSS styling for this post and the others.

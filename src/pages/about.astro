        <p> Welcome to the Music by Mood blog!<br> As you know, music can tell a story just as easily as words. <br>
            This site is designed to give you a peek into the music of my soul.<br> 
            Whether I'm feeling happy, sad, energetic, or relaxed, there is always a song or soundtrack to reflect these emotions.<br></p> 
        </p></div>
        <div>
        <p>Enjoy this snapshot into my soul through the music I love!<br> I will be adding more content soon, so please check back for updates!</p></div>

     <p> Some days the sky is hidden behind a thick layer of clouds. <br>
       It is as if a curtain has been drawn over the sun, casting a soft, diffused light over everything. <br>
        Sometimes it is heavy, grey and ominous, threatening rain at any moment,and other times it is soft and protective, shielding us from the harsh glare of the sun. <br>
